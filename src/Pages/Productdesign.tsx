              <p>
                <b>Product Design (PD) </b>is the process of creating and
                developing a physical or digital product from <br />
                concept to completion ensuring they meet the users goals and
                business goals. This track <br /> encompasses a wide range of
                skills, including user research, user interface (UI) design,
                interaction <br />
                design, prototyping, and usability testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Product designers collaborate closely with cross-functional
                teams, from developers to marketers, to <br />
                create innovative and user-friendly products. In essence,
                product design is about solving problems, <br />
                empathizing with users, and translating their needs into
                elegant, intuitive, and visually appealing <br />
                solutions.
